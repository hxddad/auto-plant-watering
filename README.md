# Arduino Plant Watering System 
This project is an automated water-feeding system for plants written in Java and actuated from Arduino.  The Arduino decides on the task of whether to water the plant, depending on the moisture of the soil.  The system can be left alone for a while to water the plant as needed, until the user manually decides to stop the system.
